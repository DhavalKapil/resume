      Backdoor is a platform for hackers to show their talent in a competitive
      environment. Earlier it was launched only within the IIT Roorkee campus,
      but now it has been made available for anyone over the internet.
      It is a Capture the Flag styled event. A flag (basically a string) is
      associated with every challenge. Once you have solved a particular
      challenge you would get the hidden flag which you need to submit
      back to us for getting points.
